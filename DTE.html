	<h2> Blender </h2>
	
	<p> Blender is a 3d design used for making 3d rooms, character designs etc. It is used by some graphic designers. The first project I did was to create was to create a 3d room, which took 3 day(ig).
	After that, Mr Morales taught me to animate a character. So me and the class did the rigging of a cube and the character.
