    <p> I was immigrated in New Zealand 4 months ago. My father was a software engineer back in Kuwait, now my father is a work-in-home person.
	My mother is a nurse. She works in Middlemore Hospital. In my family, I have 6 members. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. My brother is Year 9 and
	studies in the same college and is selected in the OC u14 football club. My sister is year 4 in OPS (Otahuhu Primary School). And my 3 year old brother
	is in pre-school. Still getting used to this college.</p>
